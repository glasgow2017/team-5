General ideas for talking points:
First:
talk about what we're trying to solve, problem break down(high level)

Second:
Implementation details, design probs, arguments, team organisations, challenges,


More specific ideas:

Use globe in all slides?
First Presentation:

Lets put ourselves in their shoes

Problems that women in poorer countries face (prevalence of violence, education limited, employment)

Approach to improvement (create game to test people knowledge on their country, showing them steps to improve things)

Our game (globe, obstacle course thing?)

Second Presentation:
Challenges faced (Terrible API, team organisation)

Terrible API (how we solved?)

Team organisation (how we solved?)

Limits of our implementation (only a single data source?)

How it could be extended (add more data sources)
